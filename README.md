Summary:

• A Drawback of The Webpage Pertains to how it can be Challenging for a User to Determine which Option to choose from The Options Available Under Each Filter Category for Filtering The Data On The Webpage.

• One Idea As A Recommendation For Further Development Of The Webpage Is To Implement A Button For Clearing Filters.

• Another Idea As A Recommendation For Further Development Of The Webpage Is To Implement Drop Down Options That Can Be Clicked On For All Values Pertaining To Each Filter Type Instead Of Fields To Type Into For Each Filter Type.
